Introduction
============

`contactpp` generates pseudopotentials for interparticle interactions which
accurately reproduce the contact potential. Potentials can be generated to
reproduce the bound state, or scattering states with either positive or
negative scattering lengths. This program currently only offers
norm-conserving pseudopotentials in the form detailed by Troullier and Martins.

The formalism is detailed in [BLNC]_.
